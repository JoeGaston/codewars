// ! Codewars Challenge: Parse nice int from char problem

// You ask a small girl,"How old are you?" She always says, "x years old", where x is a random number between 0 and 9.

// Write a program that returns the girl's age (0-9) as an integer.

// Assume the test input string is always a valid string. For example, the test input may be "1 year old" or "5 years old". The first character in the string is always a number.


// ! Psuedo code

// I need a randon number first. I want to use math.random and math.floor to create this inside the function.
// Because im not using a prompt, the function will simply take in a string-numer ('9').
// The first thing i need to do is convert the string to a number. Im going to use the number() method. There is another method called parseint() that i may try as well.



// ! My solution

function getAge(inputString){
    // return the girl's correct age as an integer. Happy coding :)
    }

let ageNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)
let ageString = ageNum.toString()
console.log(ageString)
